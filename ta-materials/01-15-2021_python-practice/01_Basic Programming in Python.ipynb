    "### [Variables and Some Arithmetic](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini2/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Goals \n",
    "- Store values into `variables` \n",
    "- Learn about variable `types`, such as `int`, `float`, and `str` objects in Python\n",

    "\n",
    "*Primitive types* are the basic building blocks of a programming language. Examples in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`int`** objects (otherwise known as *integers*), for integers between -2 billion and 2 billion\n",
    "- **`float`** objects for numbers with a decimal present \n",
    "- **`bool`** objects (otherwise known as *booleans*), can have a value of either `True` or `False`\n",
    "- **`str`** objects (otherwise known as *strings*) for sequences of alphanumeric characters\n",
    "- **`None`** \n",

    "- **`list`** data structures (denoted with `[]`) for ordered sequences\n",
    "- **`str`** data structures (denoted with `\"\"`) for ordered sequences of alphanumeric characters (can often do list operations on strings)\n",
    "- **`dict`** data structures (denoted with `{key: value}`) for indexed pairs of {lookup index, value}\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What are loops? \n",
    "\n",
    "*Loops* are control structures that are used to repeat a given section of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met. Within Python, there are two types of loops that are ecommonly used, `for loop` that are used for iterating over a sequence, or `while loop` that are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. \n",

    "*Dictionaries* (`dict`) are another basic data structure common to many languages, including Python. A dictionary allows you to take any *value*, and assign it a unique lookup index, or *key*. You can then look up this value, using the key, very efficiently using the `dict` object. You can store anything in the value: a `str`, a `list`, even another `dict`!\n",
