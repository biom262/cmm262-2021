    "## Background to Code Tracing: Learning How to Read Code like a Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Code tracing is a method where a programmer uses pencil and paper--or mentally--to hand-trace the execution of a program or block of code in order to track how variable values change during execution and to also determine the output of the given section of code. Code tracing is an effective way to troubleshoot errors across all programing languages, learn how a program functions, as well as get familiar with the syntax with a given programming language! \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <p>Tracing code is a <i>different</i> skill from writing code and should be mastered before attempting to write code from scratch! Before you're able to write original code, you should be able to predict the behavior of code for the language that you're interested in.</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two tracing skills that are important for interpreting what a given segment of code is doing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Tracing** is where you trace the value stored within variables as a segment of code is executed, line-by-line \n",
    "2. **Program Tracing** is where you track the *flow* of a program, especially in learning when loops start and execute or when conditional code blocks are executed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Tracing Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this section of the notebook, I'll be going through a small segment of code and how I would trace through it, line-by-line. I would like to determine what value is displayed at the end of the following code block: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "n = 1729 \n",
    "total = 0 \n",
    "while n>0:\n",
    "    digit = int(n % 10)\n",
    "    total = total + digit \n",
    "    n = int(n/10) \n",
    "print(total)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Tracing Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "While I don't have a sheet of paper, here are the steps that I went through to figure out what the final output would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It seems like from this code block, there are three variables present, `n`, `total`, and `digit`\n",
    "2. The first two variables, `n` and `total` are initialized with `1729` and `0`, respectively before we reach the while-loop\n",
    "3. Because `n=1729` is greater than 0, we enter the while-loop : \n",
    "    1. The variable `digit` is set to `1729 % 10 = 9` (remember, the modulo (`%`) operator calculates the remainder after division)\n",
    "    2. The variable `total` is then set to `0 + 9 = 9` \n",
    "    3. The variable `n` is set to `1729/10 = 172` \n",
    "4. We then check the loop condition again; because `n=172` is greater than 0, we enter the while-loop a second time: \n",
    "    1. The variable `digit` is set to `172 % 10 = 2` \n",
    "    2. The variable `total` is then set to `9 + 2 = 11` \n",
    "    3. The variable `n` is set to `172/10 = 17` \n",
    "5. We then check the loop condition again; because `n=17` is greater than 0, we enter the while-loop a third time: \n",
    "    1. The variable `digit` is set to `17 % 10 = 7`\n",
    "    2. The variable `total` is then set to `11 + 7 = 18`\n",
    "    3. The variable `n` is set to `17/10 = 1`\n",
    "6. We then check the loop condition again; because `n=1` is greater than 0, we enter the while-loop a fourth time: \n",
    "    1. The variable `digit` is set to `1 % 10 = 1`\n",
    "    2. The variable `total` is then set to `18 + 1 = 19`\n",
    "    3. The variable `n` is set to `1/10 = 0`\n",
    "7. We then check the loop condition again; because `n=0` is **not** greater than 0, we end the while-loop \n",
    "8. We then print the value of `total`, which should be `19` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What was the point of that exercise? \n",
    "\n",
    "This might be you at the moment: \n",
    "\n",
    "> *The code segment we went through above was super simple! We could have just ran the code manually!* \n",
    "\n",
    "However, code tracing does more than just understand code that works correctly; it can also be used to **find errors** within your existing code. When your code behaves in ways that you wouldn't expect, it's helpful to trace through the variables and program flow to see what is being executed line-by-line to track where the issue might lie. \n",
    "\n",
    "But for fun, the code block below has the code that we traced through above: "
