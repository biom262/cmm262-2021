# Variant Calling
This module covers the basics of performing Variant Calling in sequencing datasets, in which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions or deletions (index) are identified within one's samples. It is taught by Professor Olivier Harismendy, an Associate Professor at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center and head of the oncogenomics laboratory (https://medschool.ucsd.edu/research/moores/research/oncogenomics-lab/Pages/default.aspx).
