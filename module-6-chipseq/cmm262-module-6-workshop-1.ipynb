    "* Most of the workshop will be done using **HOMER** (e.g., QC of the data, peak calling etc.; <a href=\"http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/\" target=\"_blank\">http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/</a>). HOMER was created by Chris Benner at UCSD, and I love the documentation and tutorials and the threaded humor.
