    "| Fixing typos which lead to incorrect code or confusing wording | +1% grade increase | You can submit corrections to wording of certain steps or code snippets that were used in an assignment or presentation! Submitting regular typo updates (e.g., `Heere` corrected to `Here`) will not give you any extra credit unless it corrects code that would not have worked if one were to copy and paste it directly. | \n",
    "| Extending an existing explaination of a step | +1% grade increase | You can add useful explainations and/or conceptual justifications for why we were performing a step (e.g., why we filter out genes with low read counts in RNA-seq analysis)! | \n",
    "| Pointing to good, existing resources or tutorials on a topic | +1% grade increase | You can include links to online resources that helped you understand the concepts behind a certain analysis, however, you *must state the sections of the resource which are relevant and tie them directly to the course material it helps with* (e.g., why is a StackOverflow post helpful for using a certain method in `scikit-learn`?). | \n",
    "| Submitting extra material or tutorial you put together yourself | +3% grade increase | You can submit an analysis pipeline we didn't cover or any extra material you think would be helpful to the course! Your tutorial must be in `.ipynb` or `.pdf` format. | \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are submitting a pull request to either include additional resources/tutorials on a topic (for the +1% grade increase) or submit additional teaching materials (for the +3% grade increase), everything you add has to be **directly connected to the course material** and needs to include where you got any information you sourced from another location (e.g., a StackOverflow link). \n",
